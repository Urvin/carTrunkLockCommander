Car trunk lock commander
=====================

> *Firstly designed for my Lifan Smily (Lifan 320) car*

This is a motor- and wire- protection device for car trunk lock actuator/solenoid.
When you push the button, solenoid works for 0.8 second and then turns off, independently if you still hold the button or note.
This time is enough to open a trunk and top protect system to work on high-ampere current.
